# **My Data Visualization Notebook Collection** 

Hey there! 

This is just my **personal collection** of visualization notebooks. Nothing fancy, no groundbreaking discoveries—just a place where I store the plotting codes I use **way too often** so I don’t have to rewrite them every time.   

If you accidentally stumbled upon this repo, feel free to look around! Maybe you'll find something useful, or maybe you'll just shake your head at my obsession with well-labeled charts. Either way, welcome! 

## **What's Inside?**  
Some of my go-to visualization techniques, including:  

**Histograms** – Because data distributions deserve attention.  
**Line Charts** – For when trends are actually interesting.  
**Bar Charts** – A simple classic that never gets old.  
**Other random visuals** that I find useful now and then.  

## **Why This Exists?**  
- I’m **too lazy** to Google the same thing every time.  
- I like **having my own quick-access plotting toolbox.**  
- Sometimes I just enjoy making data look pretty.
